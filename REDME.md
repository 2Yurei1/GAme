# Trexquant Hangman Problem

## Description
This project implements a solution to the Hangman problem using machine learning techniques. Several Jupyter notebooks are provided, each containing different approaches to solve the problem. The primary goal is to create an API that can guess letters in the Hangman game with high accuracy.
